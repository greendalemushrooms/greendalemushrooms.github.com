* mushroom themed favicon
* seperate page (probably) to show off the whole mushroom/compost process
* www.@ doesn't seem to work. Try doing a *. CNAME or A name or whatever. I am sure github said something about redirecting www to @?
* markdown and pandoc template?
* bigger text
* reactive css
* ask folks: more images to illusttrate new text, favicon, editing (remove
* power bit, quotes).
