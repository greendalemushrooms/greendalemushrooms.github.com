<p>Geof and Kate Clark's business,
Greendale Mushrooms, is a massive
recycling operation.</p>
<p>"Our whole operation uses waste products of wheat straw and
chicken litter to make compost. Then we grow mushrooms in
it. and sell the waste compost to gardeners," Geoff explains.</p>
<p>The couple have owned the mushroom business. based at
Norwood on the north bank of the Selwyn River near Burnham,
since last June. Before that they were sharemilking at Dorie.</p>
<p>Although the hours are slightly better than cows, it's still a seven
day a week operation.</p>
<p>The couple are one of eight commercial mushroom growers in
New Zealand but one of the smallest yet.</p>
<p>Geoff says the business is a mix of scientific and technical
knowledge and is very hands on. "Mushrooms have a mind of their
own and can be quite unpredictable in their timing."</p>
<p>They have a great staff of eight, including six permanent part
time pickers who work when the mushrooms are ready to pick.</p>
<p>Their white button mushrooms are mainly sold in Christchurch
through MG to local supermarkets and wholesalers.</p>
<p>They have 1000 square metres of growing sheds and have been
expanding consistently, up from a production of 800kg of
mushrooms per week to the current level of 3 tonnes per
week.</p>
<p>A further 25% expansion is about to be made which will utilise
all the growing room in their sheds.</p>
<p>They make all their own compost — some 12 tonne per week -
mixing up the wheat straw and chicken litter with water,
forming the compost into long lines called ricks.</p>
<p>In the first week the temperature inside the ricks goes up to
around 70°C due to the exothermic composting procedure.</p>
<p>After that the compost is moved into a pasteurisation tunnel
built from a re-purposed 40 foot refrigerated container. In there 60°C air is
pumped through the compost to kill any undesired bacteria pathogens. The
compost is then held at 50°C for a week.</p>
<p>This conditions the compost which comes out of the tunnel
black, friable and moist.</p>
<p>Wheat germ impregnated with mushroom spawn is seeded throughout the compost
which fills specially made growing boxes. The mushroom mycelium then grows for
two weeks through the compost. The compost is kept in warm in rooms of 20 to
25°C with constant humidity and carbon dioxide levels to stimulate mycelium
growth, before being cased with a peat layer.</p>
<p>A week later they get transferred to Kate's part of the operation where she
introduces fresh air to the room and drops the temperature to 17°C. This
induces the mycelium to form pins, which develop into mushrooms, the first of
which are harvested 10 days later.</p>
<p>They harvest four flushes of mushrooms from each growing
room over a four week period, and after that the compost is
steamed and sold off to residential gardeners where it has proven to be a
great success.</p>
<p>Each stage of the mushroom's development needs different
humidity, temperature, airflow and carbon dioxide levels, Geoff
explains, and water is critical too, since it makes up around 90%
of the mushroom.</p>
<p>"It's a massively technical operation."</p>
<p>The Clarks use both a diesel boiler and electricity to power their
business.</p>
<p>The boiler produces steam to sterilise the boxes, pasteurises the
compost and also powers a radiator for heating air.</p>
<p>Electricity is used to power the rest of their operation.</p>
<p>They have fans to blow air through the compost to keep it
aerobic and this means there's no smell to annoy the neighbours,
They also use computer-controlled fans to blow and recirculate
air in the pasteurisation tunnel and fans pull air through filters
into the growing rooms.</p>
<p>"The farm has to be very sterile; any air coming in has to be
filtered. Any disease spores or bacteria can wipe out a crop."</p>
<p>There are air conditioners in each of the seven growing rooms
and three in Geoff's preparation area to control the environment
while the mycelium are growing through the compost.</p>
<p>Their power use is constant through the week, helped by the
huge amount of insulation in the growing shed walls and roofs.</p>
<p>Geoff explains they had always been Meridian ATS customers
while they were share-milking on an irrigated property.</p>
<p>"When we shifted from the dairy farm we had Nick Purcell, our
telephone account manager rural, have a look through our
accounts and he said there was one plan that may suit us better.</p>
<p>"Our power use is almost constant every day, so he suggested it
might be easier to change to the Day/Night Weekender plan.</p>
<p>This plan is a popular option for a seven-day-a—week operation.
Giving a standard day unit rate but a much cheaper night and
weekend rate for 98 hours of the week. Nick says for any
operation that runs consistently through the week and into the
weekend it in most cases works out better.</p>
<p>Geoff took meter readings night and morning for just over a
week. Then Nick fed the figures through a spreadsheet and
found that the new plan would give a saving of $250 a month.</p>
<p>"So that's taking our monthly bill for power in the shed down
from $1850 to $1580. It's a big saving over a year of close to
$3000."</p>
<p>"The other challenge we have in our business is to get people
eating more mushrooms". Geoff says.</p>
<p>To help promote the business, Greendale Mushrooms are part of
the Commercial Mushroom Growers Federation who's new website,
