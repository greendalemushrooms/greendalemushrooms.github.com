Greendale Mushrooms is an established, rapidly growing mushroom farm set
right of the heart of Canterbury, New Zealand. Located on the wide flat
plains between the Southern Alps and the ocean, only half an hour from
Christchurch city.

Owned and run by Geoff and Kate Clark, who bought the 10 year old
mushroom farm in 2007. After extensive restructuring, some injection of
funds, and countless hours of hard work, they have increased the
production to 3 tonnes a week of white button mushrooms.

The whole process involved in the production of mushrooms is
eco-friendly, and is one of the most renewable businesses you could
find.

The mushrooms are housed in a complex of insulated growing rooms with
regulated environments, growing in beds of compost made from the
by-products of other industries. Summed up by Geoff "our whole operation
uses the waste products of wheat straw and chicken litter to make
compost. Then we grow mushrooms in it, and sell the finished compost to
gardeners". Indeed, after weeks of tightly controlled processes they
develop compost which is perfect to grow fruitful crops of mushrooms,
after this use the compost is sold to private gardeners and landscaping
companies.

With the help of a team of local staff the mushrooms are picked, graded
and packed in boxes everyday and trucked fresh from the property to
nearby MG Produce market in Christchurch. From there the mushrooms are
distributed to retailers, wholesalers and supermarkets mainly in the
local Canterbury region.
