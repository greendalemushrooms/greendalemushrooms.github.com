       Greendale Mushrooms is an established, rapidly growing mushroom farm set right of the heart of Canterbury, New Zealand. Located on the wide flat plains between the Southern Alps and the ocean, only half an hour from Christchurch city.
       </p>
       <p>
       Owned and run by Geoff and Kate Clark, who bought the 10 year old mushroom farm in 2007. After extensive restructuring, some injection of funds, and countless hours of hard work, they have increased the production to 3 tonnes a week of white button mushrooms.
       </p>
       <p>
       The whole process involved in the production of mushrooms is eco-friendly, and is one of the most renewable businesses you could find.
       </p>
       <p>
       The mushrooms are housed in a complex of insulated growing rooms with regulated environments, growing in beds of compost made from the by-products of other industries. Summed up by Geoff "our whole operation uses the waste products of wheat straw and chicken litter to make compost. Then we grow mushrooms in it, and sell the finished compost to gardeners". Indeed, after weeks of tightly controlled processes they develop compost which is perfect to grow fruitful crops of mushrooms, after this use the compost is sold to private gardeners and landscaping companies.
       </p>
       <p>
       With the help of a team of local staff the mushrooms are picked, graded and packed in boxes everyday and trucked fresh from the property to nearby MG Produce market in Christchurch. From there the mushrooms are distributed to retailers, wholesalers and supermarkets mainly in the local Canterbury region.
